Step 1: Run the Preprocessing.py file. This generates an 'output.csv' file which will have the processed data.
Make sure the data file, 'cumulative_2020.09.04_15.26.41.csv' and the Preprocessing.py file are in the same folder.

Step 2: Run the corresponding file to run the classification algorithm on the 'output.csv'data.

To run Random Forest Classifier: Run RandomForest_withCV.py file. Make sure that the 'output.csv' and 'RandomForest_withCV.py' files are in the same folder.

To run Naive Baye's Classifier:

To run AdaBoost Classifier:
  1) download python and package prerequisites
  2) 'python 3 adaboost.py' should result in the confusion matrices and accuracy results. 
  3) Make sure that the 'output.csv' file is in the same folder/the directory for loading in data is updated to teh proper location with 'output.csv'

To run Logistic Regression Classifier:

To run Voting Classifier:

To run Neural Network Classifier:
